# All assets needed for this project

inputs: data and code (not documented elsewhere, you do not need to document intermediate code and data that fall into the ProjectTemplate or drake process flow, since we know how that works!)
outputs: plots, files, documents, produced by the analysis

The list of assets should not be onerous. It should contain a name, path to where the assets can be found, and a short description.
