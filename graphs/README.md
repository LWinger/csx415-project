## Exploratory Data Analysis Graphs

The plots here were generated in the EDA portion of the analysis using the script in the `csx415-project\src\3_EDA` directory and lead to determining which of the original features may have predictive power. Of the 21 sensors, 15 were selected for the models as input features. Grid search and feature selection was still used during the training to further refine the feature selection.
